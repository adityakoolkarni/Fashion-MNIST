Deep Neural Network Implementation 

Files:
1)checker.py 
2)config.yaml
3)neuralnet.py

Description: To run the Neural Network use "python neuralnet.py" command on the terminal and set the required configuration in the config.yaml. The neural network has momemtum based learning updates for weights and early stopping is implemented to save the best weights. Different activations are also coded here which can be chosen from the config file.
